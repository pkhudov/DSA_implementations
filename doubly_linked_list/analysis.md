# Complexity Analysis: Doubly Linked List

## Time

- length: O(1) because it is stored in a variable.

Same as in linked list, however in practice it is double as fast because we can traverse the list from both directions. O(n/2) = O(n)

- get: O(n)
- set: O(n):
- insert: O(n):
- delete: O(n):

- append: O(1) because we keep a reference to the tail

## Space

- O(n) because for each element we store data and 2 pointers. O(3n) = O(n)
